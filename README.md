Disclaimer:
-----------

 - An IRIDIUM IR9523 OEM module and an active subscription and simcard are required for this project.
 - The modems behave as transparent link. This means calls are answered automatically and all data sent to the module are tranmitted via space as soon as a connection is made.
 - Iridium antennas send strong signals and people must stay at a safe distance from the antenna. Consult all iridium documentation before use.
